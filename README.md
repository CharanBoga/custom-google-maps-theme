# Custom Google Maps Theme Project

Welcome to the Custom Google Maps Theme project! This project aims to guide you through creating and styling a Google Map with a custom color theme and markers using the Google Cloud Platform and Google Maps JavaScript API.

## Overview

In this project, you'll learn how to:

- Display a Google Map on your website with a custom color theme.
- Center the map at a particular latitude/longitude.
- Use custom markers around the map.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Set Up Your Environment**: Ensure you have access to a code editor and a web browser. You'll also need a Google account to access the Google Cloud Platform.

2. **Create a Google Cloud Platform Project**: Go to the Google Cloud Platform console (https://console.cloud.google.com/) and create a new project. Enable the Google Maps JavaScript API for this project.

3. **Style Your Map in Google Map Management**: Use the Google Maps Platform Styling Wizard to customize the colors and appearance of your map. You can create a custom theme or choose from existing ones.

4. **Obtain Map ID and API Key**: Once you've styled your map, obtain the map ID and API key from the Google Cloud Platform console. These will be used to load the map on your website using the Google Maps JavaScript API.

5. **Write Your Project Code**: Create HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for your project. Use the obtained map ID and API key to load the map on your website and customize its appearance and functionality.

6. **Test Your Map**: Ensure your map displays correctly on different browsers and devices. Test its functionality, including centering, zooming, and custom markers.
